            <div class="section__text"><p>A gamer is a person who plays interactive games, especially video games, tabletop role-playing games,
                and skill-based card games, and who plays for usually long periods of time. Some gamers are competitive, 
               meaning that they compete in some games for money. In some countries such as the UK and Australia,
                the term "gaming" can refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional and digital forms,
                through online gambling. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of 
               the Internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch virtual communities, as wel
               l as in-person social clubs. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a profession for some. 
               In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes.[1][2]</p>
